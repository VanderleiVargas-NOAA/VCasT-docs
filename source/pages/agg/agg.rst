Aggregation Component
=====================

The **Aggregation (agg)** component in VCasT is responsible for grouping and summarizing verification statistics across dimensions such as forecast lead time, model, or thresholds.

This module supports configurable grouping and confidence interval estimation, enabling compact statistical summaries from raw `.stat` file outputs or reformatted metrics.
