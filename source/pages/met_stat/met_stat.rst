MET Stat Component
==================

The **MET Stat** component of VCasT is designed to process and analyze `.stat` output files generated by the `Model Evaluation Tools (MET) <https://metplus.readthedocs.io/projects/met/en/latest/>`_
. These files contain verification statistics from meteorological models and observations.

VCasT simplifies the post-processing of `.stat` files by allowing users to:

- Filter data by date, forecast lead time, model, variable, thresholds, and more.
- Extract relevant verification metrics (e.g., RMSE, bias, GSS, FSS, CSI).
- Aggregate results across leads or other dimensions.
- Generate output files for plotting or further statistical analysis.

The filtering and processing behavior is controlled via a YAML configuration file. For a complete description of this file, see:  
:doc:`MET Stat YAML Configuration <met_stat/met_stat_config>`

This component is especially useful for batch verification pipelines where multiple `.stat` files are produced across different models, thresholds, or initialization times.

.. note::
   Only `.stat` files with a consistent MET format are supported. Files should reside in a single directory as defined in the configuration file.
