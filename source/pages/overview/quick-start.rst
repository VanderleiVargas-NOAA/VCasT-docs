Quick Start Guide
=================

This guide walks you through setting up VCasT in a Python environment for immediate use and testing. It assumes you have Python 3.8+ installed and access to Git.

1. Set Up a Virtual Environment
-------------------------------

Using a virtual environment is recommended to avoid dependency conflicts.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv venv

Activate the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate

2. Install VCasT
----------------

VCasT is hosted on GitHub and can be installed directly using pip.

Full version (recommended â€“ includes all features and dependencies):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "git+https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/VCasT.git@develop#egg=vcast[all]"

This installs the following dependencies:

- `matplotlib<=3.8.4`
- `pandas<=2.2.2`
- `scipy<=1.13.0`
- `numpy<=1.26.4`
- `xarray<=2024.4.0`
- `netCDF4<=1.6.5`
- `zarr<=2.17.0`
- `pygrib<=2.1.5`

Lite version (minimal dependencies for plotting and basic metrics):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "git+https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/VCasT.git@develop#egg=vcast[lite]"

This installs:

- `matplotlib<=3.8.4`
- `pandas<=2.2.2`
- `scipy<=1.13.0`
- `numpy<=1.26.4`

3. Confirm the Installation
---------------------------

Verify that the `vcast` CLI is available in your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   which vcast

4. Run the Test Suite
---------------------

To ensure your installation is working, you can run the full test suite.

First, clone the test repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/VCasT-tests
   mv VCasT-tests tests

Then install `pytest` if needed and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pytest
   pytest -v tests

This will validate the core functionality of the library, including its metric calculations and I/O behavior.

5. (Optional) Clone the VCasT Source Code
-----------------------------------------

If you intend to contribute to VCasT or explore its internals:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/VCasT
   cd VCasT
   git submodule update --init --recursive

This also pulls in any optional submodules (e.g., examples and tests).

6. Next Steps
-------------

- Read the :doc:`Introduction <introduction>` to understand what VCasT can do.
